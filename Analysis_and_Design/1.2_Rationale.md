# Rationale

The UML class diagram has been updated to accurately reflect the specified business requirements for customer management and account functionalities, incorporating three distinct account types: Everyday Account, Investment Account, and Omni Account.

The inclusion of the Customer class addresses the need for managing customer data within the banking application, encompassing essential attributes such as customerNumber, name, and contactDetails. This ensures efficient record-keeping and personalized interactions with customers.

The Account class serves as the foundation for representing various account types, including attributes such as accountNumber, balance, interestRate, overdraftLimit, and feeForFailedTxn. Common methods for depositing, withdrawing, and tracking transactions are associated with this class, providing a unified interface for managing accounts across different types.

In addition to the generic Account class, specialized account types are represented by subclasses: EverydayAccount, InvestmentAccount, and OmniAccount. Each subclass introduces specific features and behaviors tailored to its respective account type, such as interest calculation methods, fee structures, and transaction capabilities.

The InterestAccount class, extending the Account class, encapsulates functionality related to interest rate computations, reinforcing modularity and code reusability. This design choice promotes scalability and facilitates the incorporation of additional account types with similar requirements in the future.

Overall, the revised UML class diagram design strikes a balance between flexibility, comprehensiveness, and adherence to the specified business requirements. It provides a solid foundation for the development of a robust banking application capable of effectively managing customer data and supporting various account functionalities.
