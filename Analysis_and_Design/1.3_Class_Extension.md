# Assignment 3s Class Extension:

Class Extensions Report

In response to Task 3, we have extended the data model from Assessment 1 to incorporate the necessary functionality for handling one-to-many relationships and distinguishing between general customers and bank staff within the classes. Below is a detailed report outlining the updates made to the Customer, Account, and Controller classes, including their attributes and methods.
Customer Class Extension:

    Attributes:
        customerType: Added to differentiate between general customers and bank staff. It allows for categorizing customers based on their role.
    Methods:
        setCustomerType(type): Method to set the customer type.
        getCustomerType(): Method to retrieve the customer type.

Account Class Extension:

    Attributes:
        owner: Changed to allow for a one-to-many relationship between customers and accounts. It now holds a reference to the owner (customer or bank staff).
    Methods:
        setOwner(owner): Method to set the owner of the account.
        getOwner(): Method to retrieve the owner of the account.
        addOwner(owner): Method to add additional owners to the account. This facilitates the one-to-many relationship.

Controller Class Extension:

    Attributes:
        staffAccounts: Added to manage accounts associated with bank staff. It allows for easy retrieval and manipulation of staff-specific accounts.

    Methods:
        addStaffAccount(account): Method to add a staff account to the controller's list of accounts.
        removeStaffAccount(account): Method to remove a staff account from the controller's list of accounts.
        getStaffAccounts(): Method to retrieve all staff accounts managed by the controller.

Justification:

    One-to-Many Relationship Handling:
        The extension of the Account class to include an owner attribute allows for establishing a one-to-many relationship between customers and accounts. This modification enables accounts to have multiple owners, accommodating scenarios where joint accounts are held by multiple individuals.

    Customer Type Differentiation:
        The addition of the customerType attribute to the Customer class enables the distinction between general customers and bank staff. This differentiation facilitates tailored functionalities and access levels based on the customer's role within the banking system.

    Controller Management Enhancement:
        The inclusion of the staffAccounts attribute and associated methods in the Controller class enhances the management of staff-specific accounts. This addition streamlines account administration tasks and ensures efficient handling of accounts associated with bank staff members.

Conclusion:

The extensions made to the Customer, Account, and Controller classes enhance the functionality of the banking application by enabling the management of one-to-many relationships and distinguishing between different types of customers. These updates contribute to the overall scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of the system, aligning with the project's objectives and requirements.
